      A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a farm boy on a desert planet dreamed of joining a rebellion
      and saving a princess from a dark lord, and thus, one of the most successful cinematic sagas of all time
      was born. What began with one space opera in 1977 quickly grew into a media empire that included toys,
      comic books, video games, TV series, and memorabilia in every possible form. Today, more than 40 years
      after it first arrived, Star Wars remains a global pop culture phenomenon, and the story still isn't over.
